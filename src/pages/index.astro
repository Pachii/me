        I'm a fourth-year undergraduate computer science student at Georgia Tech
        üêù, graduating in Spring 2025 and continuing with the Master's program
        in the fall. My academic focus spans topics including artificial
        intelligence, machine learning, and distributed systems, but more
        broadly, I enjoy tackling unique challenges and building impactful
        solutions. <br />Beyond academics, I love creating, organizing, and
        bringing ideas to life. Whether it's leading large-scale projects,
        managing dynamic teams, or designing a product from the ground up, I
        thrive in turning concepts into reality and making things happen. My
        approach is driven by efficiency and user impact, ensuring that every
        solution I develop is not only effective‚Äîbut also refined, scalable, and
        meaningful.

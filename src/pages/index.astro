        I'm a first year master's student in computer science at Georgia Tech
        üêù, graduating in December 2026. My academic focus spans topics including
        artificial intelligence, machine learning, and networking, but
        more broadly, I enjoy tackling unique challenges and building impactful
        solutions.

        Beyond academics, I love creating, organizing, and bringing ideas to
        life. Whether it's leading large-scale projects, managing dynamic teams,
        or designing a product from the ground up, I thrive in turning concepts
        into reality and making things happen. My approach is driven by
        efficiency and user impact, ensuring that every solution I develop is
        not only effective‚Äîbut also refined, scalable, and meaningful.

        I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech üêù,
        graduating in Spring 2025 and continuing with the Master's program in
        the fall. My interests span artificial intelligence, machine learning,
        and distributed systems, but more broadly, I enjoy solving unique
        problems and building impactful solutions. Beyond academics, I love
        creating, organizing, and bringing ideas to life. Whether it's leading
        projects, designing products, or managing teams, I thrive in turning
        concepts into reality and making things happen.
